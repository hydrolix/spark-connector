# Hydrolix Spark Connector

## Overview

This is a Spark [TableCatalog](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.2/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/TableCatalog.html)/"DataSourceV2" 
implementation that lets customers write Spark 3.3.x and 3.4.x jobs that directly query data stored in 
[Hydrolix](https://hydrolix.io/) tables, without any ETL process.

The mainline Hydrolix query engine supports the [Clickhouse SQL dialect](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference), 
but this connector can execute queries in any of the following:
 * Spark SQL
 * Scala
 * PySpark

In fact, the connector supports queries using an any arbitrary combination of these languages, thanks to Spark's 
unifying DataFrame abstraction.

## Architecture

![diagram](./doc/architecture.png)

### Hydrolix Spark Catalog
* Implements the Spark [TableCatalog](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.2/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/TableCatalog.html) 
  interface
* Makes requests to the Hydrolix query head (via JDBC) and API (via REST client) to collect metadata about the 
  databases, tables, partitions and columns that are accessible to the authenticated user.
* Provides implementations of the Spark types necessary to run queries, including: 

  | Spark Type                                                                                                                             | Connector Implementation                                                                               |

### hdx_reader
An operating mode of the `turbine_cmd` binary, launched by `HdxPartitionReader` as a child process to read Hydrolix 
partitions. Packaged in the JAR, [not open source](#proprietary)!

### Hydrolix Cluster
A preexisting Hydrolix cluster; must be [version 3.40.5](https://docs.hydrolix.io/changelog/9-may-2023-v3404) or later.
The connector must be able to access the Hydrolix API (typically on port 443) and the Clickhouse Native protocol 
(typically on port 9440).

#### API
The connector talks to the Hydrolix API at query planning time using a REST client to authenticate, and to retrieve 
database, table and column metadata. The connector does not use the API for query execution.

#### Query Head
The connector talks to the Hydrolix query head at query planning time using the Clickhouse JDBC driver to retrieve 
partition and column index metadata. The connector does not use the query head for query execution. 

## Feature Set
### Query Optimizations
The connector supports the following query optimizations, in addition to the logical optimizations Spark already applies 
(e.g. removing tautologies, simplifying Boolean expressions)

#### Partition Pruning
When the query has suitable predicates based on the timestamp and/or shard key, we can use them to eliminate partitions 
from consideration based on each partition’s min/max timestamps and shard key. In some cases this can be extremely 
effective, especially in high-selectivity queries (e.g. timestamp in a narrow range).

#### Predicate Pushdown
Suitable predicates that do simple comparisons between indexed fields and literals are evaluated by the low-level 
`turbine_cmd hdx_reader` using Hydrolix indexes. Note that `hdx_reader` only applies block-level filters, so these
predicates still need to be evaluated by Spark after scanning. Also note that due to a (hopefully) temporary 
implementation restriction, only predicates on string-typed columns can be pushed down for block filtering; any other 
predicates need to be evaluated by Spark post-scanning.

#### Column Pruning
When queries only reference a subset of columns (e.g. `a`, `b` and `c` in `SELECT a, b WHERE c='foo'`), we only read the 
columns that are referenced.

#### Aggregate Pushdown
For queries that _only_ contain the following aggregates, no other selected expressions, and no `GROUP BY` or `WHERE` 
clauses, we exclusively use partition metadata to answer such queries very quickly.
* `COUNT(*)`
* `MIN(<primary key field>)`
* `MAX(<primary key field>)`

### Unsupported Features
#### Writing Data
The Hydrolix Spark Connector is currently read-only; any attempt to execute DDL or DML queries (or their Python/Scala 
equivalents) will result in an error.

## System Requirements

### JVM
The Hydrolix Spark Connector requires a minimum Java version of 11; later versions might work. Java 8 definitely 
doesn't.

### Scala
The connector is built exclusively for Scala 2.12 at the moment. You don't need to install Scala yourself, the build 
system will take care of it.

### Operating System
Currently, the connector only runs on recent AMD64/x86_64 Linux distros. Ubuntu 22.x and Fedora 38 work fine; 
Ubuntu 20.x definitely doesn't work; other distros MIGHT work. It DOES NOT work on macOS, because it uses a 
native binary built from the C++ source tree, which can only target Linux at this time.

You can *build* the connector on macOS, it just won't run. Sorry.

### Spark (for local deployments)
You’ll need to download a copy of Apache Spark 3.3.2 or 3.4.0, compiled for Scala 2.12. You can untar it to wherever you 
like and use it as-is, no configuration files need to be updated.

### Connector Jar
You’ll need the connector jar, which can be resolved using the usual Maven machinery at the following coordinates:

#### SBT
```
  libraryDependencies += "io.hydrolix" %% "hydrolix-spark-connector" % "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
```
(note that we only build for Scala 2.12 at the moment)
#### Gradle (Kotlin)
```
  implementation("io.hydrolix:hydrolix-spark-connector_2.12:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
```
#### Gradle (Groovy)
```
  implementation 'io.hydrolix:hydrolix-spark-connector_2.12:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
```
#### Maven
```
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.hydrolix</groupId>
    <artifactId>hydrolix-spark-connector_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
```

Otherwise, if you’re building locally, it will show up at [./target/scala-2.12/hydrolix-spark-connector-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](./target/scala-2.12/hydrolix-spark-connector-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar). 

## Building

1. Install [SBT](https://scala-sbt.org/) however you prefer. Your Linux distro might have it packaged already.
2. ```
   git clone git@github.com:hydrolix/spark-connector.git hydrolix-spark-connector && cd hydrolix-spark-connector
   ```
3. Run `sbt assembly` to compile and build the connector jar file.
4. If the build succeeds, the jar can be found at [./target/scala-2.12/hydrolix-spark-connector-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](./target/scala-2.12/hydrolix-spark-connector-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).

## Running

### Local Deployment
For local testing, look at the [GCS](scripts/spark-2.12-gcs.sh) or [AWS](scripts/spark-2.12-aws.sh) scripts for 
inspiration.

### Deploying on Databricks
1. Databricks Runtime 13 or higher is required
2. Upload the [connector jar](./target/scala-2.12/hydrolix-spark-connector-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) in the Libraries 
   tab, or use its [Maven coordinates](#connector-jar). 
3. Select JDK11 by [setting an environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/10.0.html#cluster-support-for-jdk-11-public-preview) 
   in `Advanced Options > Spark > Environment Variables`
4. Set `Policy` to `Unrestricted`
5. Set `Access mode` to `No isolation shared`
6. (Optional) apply configuration settings as space-separated name-value pairs in 
   `Advanced Options > Spark > Spark config`, e.g. for AWS:
   ```
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix io.hydrolix.spark.connector.HdxTableCatalog
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.api_url https://my-hdx-cluster.example.com/config/v1/
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.jdbc_url jdbc:clickhouse://my-hdx-cluster.example.com:8088?ssl=true
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.org_id <hydrolix org ID>
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.username <hydrolix username>
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.password <hydrolix password>
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.cloud_cred_1 <access key ID>
   spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.cloud_cred_2 <secret key>
   ```
   **Note:** these settings can also be applied in a notebook or from spark-shell, using 
   `spark.conf.set(<key>, <value>)`, which also allows credentials to be loaded from the Databricks secrets API; see
   [Note: Credentials](#note-credentials) 

### Deploying on AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
1. AWS EMR 6.10.0 or later is required
2. Configure JDK 11, as in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72054500)
3. TODO!

### Configuration Parameter Details
The parameters are explained in this table. Note that the configuration parameters can always be set from `spark-shell` 
or a notebook using `spark.conf.set(<name>, <value>)`, they don't need to be provided on startup.

#### Note: Credentials
All of the above configuration options can be set at runtime, so there's no need to hardcode credentials in cluster/job 
launch scripts. For example, when running the connector in a Databricks workspace, you can retrieve credentials from the 
Databricks secret manager like so:

```
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.password", dbutils.secrets.get("my-scope", "hdx-password"))
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.cloud_cred_1", dbutils.secrets.get("my-scope", "aws_access_key_id"))
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.catalog.hydrolix.cloud_cred_2", dbutils.secrets.get("my-scope", "aws_secret_access_key"))
...
sql("use hydrolix")
```

### Querying

```
%sql

use hydrolix

select count(*), min(timestamp), max(timestamp) from hydro.logs
```

```
%scala

sql("use hydrolix")

val logs = spark.sqlContext.table("hydro.logs")

val recent = logs.filter(col("timestamp") > "2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"))

recent.count()
```

## Roadmap

### Dictionary Tables
Map [Hydrolix dictionaries](https://docs.hydrolix.io/docs/dictionaries-user-defined-functions) to Spark tables, so they 
can be queried more naturally using `JOIN`s

### Performance
#### ColumnarBatch
Spark’s PartitionReaderFactory interface supports both row-oriented and columnar operating modes. The Hydrolix Spark 
connector currently uses the row-oriented mode, but we should be able to achieve higher query performance by switching 
to the columnar mode, which unlocks some vectorization opportunities.

#### Additional Aggregate Pushdown
We already run queries that only contain `COUNT(*)`, `MIN(timestamp)` and/or `MAX(timestamp)` with no `GROUP BY` or 
`WHERE` purely from the catalog, with no partition scanning at all. We could add aggregate pushdown for queries with 
some narrowly specified types of `GROUP BY` or `WHERE` clauses as well.

### Integrations

#### Secret Management Integration
Currently, the Hydrolix Spark connector needs to be directly supplied with credentials to access Hydrolix clusters and 
cloud storage. We should add integrations to retrieve credentials from various secret stores, e.g.:
* Kubernetes Secrets
* AWS Secrets Manager
* GCP Secret Manager
